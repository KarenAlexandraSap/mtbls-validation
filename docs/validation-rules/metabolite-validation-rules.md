| 11 | rule_m_100_100_001_03 | ERROR | Empty columns in metabolite assignment file. | Empty columns must not exist in metabolite assignment file. All column headers should be defined. |
| 12 | rule_m_100_100_001_04 | ERROR | Default column header name is not unique in the metabolite assignment file. | Default column header name should be unique in the metabolite assignment file. |
| 13 | rule_m_100_100_002_01 | WARNING | Sample Name columns not in metabolite assignment file. | Sample Name columns must exist in metabolite assignment file. |
| 14 | rule_m_100_100_002_02 | WARNING | MS Assay Name or NMR Assay Name columns not in metabolite assignment file | If Sample Name columns do not exist, MS Assay Name or NMR Assay Name columns should be defined in metabolite assignment file. |
| 15 | rule_m_100_100_004_01 | ERROR | Metabolite assignment file not referenced in assay file. | Metabolite assignment file must be referenced in assay file. |
| 16 | rule_m_100_100_005_01 | ERROR | Metabolite assignment file name not correct pattern. | Metabolite assignment file name must start with 'm_' and have extension '.tsv'. |
| 17 | rule_m_100_100_006_01 | ERROR | There is no row in metabolite assignment file. | No row is defined in metabolite assignment file. Add more than one row (assignment). Please ensure all xxx, including controls, QCs, standards, etc, are referenced. |
| 18 | rule_m_100_100_006_02 | ERROR | There is only one row in metabolite assignment file. | Only one row is defined in metabolite assignment file. Add more than one row (assignment). Please ensure all xxx, including controls, QCs, standards, etc, are referenced. |
| 19 | rule_m_300_090_001_01 | ERROR | Values with trailing or leading spaces in metabolite assignment file. | Values in metabolite assignment file should not start or end with space characters. |
| 20 | rule_m_300_090_005_01 | ERROR | Values for required columns not in metabolite assignment file. | All required column values should be defined in metabolite assignment file. |
| 21 | rule_m_300_090_005_02 | ERROR | Values do not meet minimum length requirement. | Each row should have a value equal or greater than the minimum length. |
| 22 | rule_m_300_090_005_03 | ERROR | Values do not meet maximum length requirement. | Each row should have a value equal or less than the maximum length. |
| 23 | rule_m_300_100_001_01 | ERROR | mass_to_charge column has empty values in metabolite assignment file. | All 'mass_to_charge' column values should be defined in metabolite assignment file. |
